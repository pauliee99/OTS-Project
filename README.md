# Pharamcy Project

* The project was developed using VS Code as IDE.
* Project initialization and dependency management were handled with Apache Maven.
* Version control was managed using Git, with remote repository hosting on GitHub. 
* AI-assisted tools were used to troubleshoot and resolve issues related to the Lombok dependency.
* I decided to use Spring Boot framework as questions about it were included in the last test set, making it relevant for practical application.
